## Markov-Chain Monte-Carlo Sampling

This repo contains code for implementation of a few famous MCMC sampling methods. They include Metropolis Hastings, Hamiltonian Monte Carlo and Gibbs Sampling. There's also some code for Importance Sampling (through Rejection Sampling) which is not a Markov-Chain method.
